# Weather Wisdom Explorer - Workflow

This document outlines the key workflows within the Weather Wisdom Explorer application, from user interaction to data processing and display.

## User Workflows

### Current Weather Search Workflow

1. **Location Search**
   - User enters a location name in the search field
   - Application provides autocomplete suggestions
   - User selects a location from the suggestions

2. **Current Weather Retrieval**
   - Application makes API request to fetch current weather data
   - Weather data is processed and displayed in the UI
   - Background changes to reflect current weather conditions

3. **Saving Weather Data**
   - User clicks "Save" button to store current weather data
   - Data is saved to local storage with a unique ID
   - Confirmation toast notification is displayed

**Workflow Diagram:**

```mermaid

    A[User enters location] --> B[App shows suggestions]
    B --> C[User selects location]
    C --> D[App fetches weather data]
    D --> E[Display weather information]
    E --> F{Save data?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Save to local storage]
    G --> H[Show confirmation]
    F -->|No| E
```

### Historical Weather Search Workflow

1. **Date Range Selection**
   - User selects a location (if not already selected)
   - User picks a date range using the date range picker
   - User clicks "Search" to retrieve historical data

2. **Historical Data Retrieval**
   - Application makes API request for the historical period
   - Data is processed and displayed in a table format
   - Charts are generated to visualize temperature trends

3. **Data Export**
   - User selects an export format (JSON, CSV, XML, PDF, MD)
   - Application processes and formats the data accordingly
   - Browser initiates a download of the exported file

**Workflow Diagram:**

```mermaid

    A[Select location] --> B[Select date range]
    B --> C[Search for data]
    C --> D[Process historical data]
    D --> E[Display data table]
    D --> F[Generate charts]
    E --> G{Export data?}
    F --> G
    G -->|Yes| H[Select export format]
    H --> I[Process data for export]
    I --> J[Download file]
    G -->|No| E
```

### Saved Weather Management Workflow

1. **Viewing Saved Records**
   - User navigates to the saved weather tab
   - Application retrieves all saved records from local storage
   - Records are displayed in a sortable, filterable table

2. **Editing Records**
   - User clicks the "Edit" button for a specific record
   - Edit form appears with pre-filled data
   - User modifies data and submits changes
   - Updated data is saved to local storage
   - Table is refreshed to show updated data

3. **Deleting Records**
   - User clicks the "Delete" button for a specific record
   - Confirmation dialog appears
   - If confirmed, record is removed from local storage
   - Table is refreshed to remove the deleted record

**Workflow Diagram:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[View saved records] --> B{User action?}
    B -->|Edit| C[Open edit form]
    C --> D[Modify data]
    D --> E[Save changes]
    E --> F[Update local storage]
    F --> G[Refresh table]
    B -->|Delete| H[Show confirmation]
    H -->|Confirm| I[Remove from storage]
    I --> G
    H -->|Cancel| A
```

### Map Visualization Workflow

1. **Map Navigation**
   - User navigates to the map tab
   - If a location is selected, map centers on that location
   - Weather information is displayed as an overlay

**Workflow Diagram:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Navigate to map tab] --> B{Location selected?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Center map on location]
    C --> D[Show weather overlay]
    B -->|No| E[Show default map view]
```

## Data Processing Workflows

### API Data Flow

1. **API Request**
   - Request is formed with location coordinates and API key
   - For demonstration, mock API response is generated
   - In production, requests would go to OpenWeatherMap API

2. **Response Processing**
   - API response is parsed into application's data models
   - Temperature conversion (Kelvin to Celsius/Fahrenheit)
   - Weather condition mapping to icons and background styles

3. **Error Handling**
   - Network errors are caught and displayed to the user
   - Invalid responses trigger error notifications
   - Fallback UI is shown when data is unavailable

**Sequence Diagram:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant A as App
    participant M as Mock API
    participant S as Storage
    
    U->>A: Search for location
    A->>M: Request weather data
    M->>A: Return response
    A->>A: Process data
    alt Success
        A->>U: Display weather
        opt Save
            A->>S: Store data
            S->>A: Confirm save
            A->>U: Show confirmation
        end
    else Error
        A->>U: Show error notification
        A->>U: Display fallback UI
    end
```

### Data Storage Flow

1. **Data Serialization**
   - Weather data objects are prepared for storage
   - Data is serialized to JSON format
   - Unique IDs are generated for each record

2. **Local Storage Operations**
   - Save: Data is appended to existing records
   - Update: Specific record is modified in place
   - Delete: Record is removed from the collection
   - Retrieve: All records or specific record by ID

3. **Data Export Processing**
   - JSON: Direct serialization of JavaScript objects
   - CSV: Data is transformed into comma-separated values
   - XML: Data is structured in XML format
   - PDF: Data is formatted and rendered as PDF
   - MD: Data is formatted as Markdown tables

**State Diagram:**

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Fetched: Get weather data
    Fetched --> Processed: Format data
    Processed --> Stored: Save to storage
    Processed --> Exported: Export
    
    Stored --> Updated: Edit record
    Stored --> Deleted: Delete record
    Updated --> Stored: Save changes
    
    Exported --> [*]
    Deleted --> [*]
```

## Component Interaction Workflows

### Parent-Child Component Flow

1. **Index → LocationSearch**
   - Parent passes location selection handler
   - Child returns selected location data
   - Parent updates state with new location

2. **Index → CurrentWeather**
   - Parent passes weather data and save handler
   - Child displays weather information
   - Child triggers save action in parent

3. **Index → WeatherHistory**
   - Parent passes historical data and handlers
   - Child displays data tables and charts
   - Child triggers export actions in parent

**Component Interaction Diagram:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Index Page] --> B[LocationSearch]
    A --> C[CurrentWeather]
    A --> D[DateRangePicker]
    A --> E[WeatherHistory]
    A --> F[EditWeatherRecord]
    
    B -->|Location Data| A
    D -->|Date Range| A
    C -->|Save Action| A
    E -->|Export Action| A
    F -->|Update Record| A
```

### State Management Flow

1. **User Input → State Update**
   - User interactions trigger state changes
   - React re-renders affected components
   - UI reflects the latest state

2. **API Data → State Update**
   - API responses update application state
   - State changes trigger UI updates
   - Components re-render with new data

3. **Local Storage → State Update**
   - Data retrieved from storage updates state
   - UI reflects the persisted data
   - Changes to storage sync with application state

**Data Flow Diagram:**

```mermaid

    A[User Input] --> B[State Update]
    C[API Data] --> B
    D[Local Storage] --> B
    
    B --> E[Component Re-render]
    E --> F[UI Update]
    B --> G[Storage Update]
    G --> D
```
